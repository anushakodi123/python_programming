In order to write a good paragraph, we need to understand the basic elements of a paragraph and how each element contributes towards the formation of a complete, coherent paragraph structure.
A good paragraph comprises a topic sentence, preferably at the beginning and all other sentences develop, support, and explain the idea introduced in the topic sentence.
he main body of the paragraph expands on supporting details for the topic statement. It can be done through facts, examples, anecdotes, or even the writer’s own analysis of the topic.
It is essential that the supporting sentences stay on topic and clearly relate to the topic sentence’s main idea. If the supporting sentences are off-topic, the paragraph will not be coherent and clear.
Sometimes, when writing the main body, writers may find themselves repeating the same word over and over again within one single sentence or across multiple sentences. If you notice that you are repeating word(s), but do not know what to put in place of the repeated word(s), look up their synonyms.
